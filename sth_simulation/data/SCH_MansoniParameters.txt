#### Hookworm parameter values. 

### Model running parameters.
repNum	500		Number of repetitions- deprecated	
nYears	22		Number of years to run - deprecated
nYearsPostTreat	0	The number of years to run *after treatment* - i.e. post-treatment equilibration time. Will override nYears if specified. - deprecated
nHosts	500		Size of definitive host population (N) 
outputFrequency	12	Nr of times per year to output, spaced regularly. Will override outputEvents if specified.  - deprecated
outputOffset	0	Otherwise starting at zero, output will be offset by this amount. Negative values are valid (useful eg to output before treatment)


### Social structure
contactAgeBreaks	0 5 10 16 80		Contact age group breaks (minus sign necessary to include zero age) anderson et al 2016 chp Iietune
betaValues	0.01 1.2 1 0.02				Relative contact rates (Beta) anderson et al 2016 chp Iietune 
rhoValues	0.01 1.2 1 0.02				Rho, contribution to the reservoir by contact age group.

### Epidemiological parameters. 
k	0.24			Shape parameter of assumed negative binomial distribution of worms amongst host - deprecated
lambda	0.34		Eggs per gram (lambda) [Value from Chan = 7.0] ### 0.14 value from de Vlas/Cheever. 
R0	1.9			Basic reproductive number (R0)   ## Vary R0 for different baseline prevalence - deprecated
ReservoirDecayRate	5	Reservoir decay rate (decay rate of eggs in the environment)
sigma	0.1754386	Worm death rate (sigma) i.e. 1/worm_life_span, same for all development stages
gamma	0.0007	Exponential density dependence of parasite adult stage (gamma) This value probably comes from Cheever.-anderson et al 2016 chp

treatInterval	1			interval between treatments in years.	- deprecated
delayToTreat	0	duration of delay because of covid-2019 in years --> overriden by values that are read in from batch file
delayStart	2	time when delay starts in years since programme start -deprecated
