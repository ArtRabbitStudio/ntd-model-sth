#### Hookworm parameter values. 

### Model running parameters.
repNum	500		Number of repetitions	
nYears	22		Number of years to run.
nYearsPostTreat	0	The number of years to run *after treatment* - i.e. post-treatment equilibration time. Will override nYears if specified.
nHosts	500		Size of definitive host population (N) 
outputFrequency	12	Nr of times per year to output, spaced regularly. Will override outputEvents if specified.
outputOffset	0	Otherwise starting at zero, output will be offset by this amount. Negative values are valid (useful eg to output before treatment)


### Social structure
contactAgeBreaks	0 5 10 20 30 45 70		Contact age group breaks (minus sign necessary to include zero age)
betaValues	0.22 1.88 1 0.53 0.53 0.53		Relative contact rates (Beta)
rhoValues	0.22 1.88 1 0.53 0.53 0.53		Rho, contribution to the reservoir by contact age group. 

### Epidemiological parameters. 
k	0.8			Shape parameter of assumed negative binomial distribution of worms amongst host
lambda	320	Eggs per gram (lambda)
R0	3	Basic reproductive number (R0)   
ReservoirDecayRate	6	Reservoir decay rate (decay rate of eggs in the environment)
sigma	1		Worm death rate (sigma) i.e. 1/worm_life_span, same for all development stages
gamma	0.07	Exponential density dependence of parasite adult stage (gamma) N.B. fecundity parameter z = exp(-gamma)

### Sexual reproduction styles. 
reproFuncName	epgFertility	## name of function for reproduction (a string).  [Deterministic] 
StochSR	TRUE		## Turn SR on or off in the stochastic model. 	[Stochastic]  

### Treatment parameters. 
treatmentBreaks	0 2 5 15 70		Minimum age of each treatment group (minus sign necessary to include zero age): Infants; Pre-SAC; SAC; Adults
coverage	0 0.75 0.75 0		Coverages [0-1]: Infants; Pre-SAC; SAC; Adults. 
drugEff	0.99					Drug efficacy [0-1]
treatStart	1				Treatment year start 
nRounds	42					Number of treatment rounds. in high-prevalence settings 2x nYears-1, because treatment occurs 2x a year	
treatInterval	0.5			interval between treatments in years.	
delayToTreat	0	duration of delay because of covid-2019 in years --> overriden by values that are read in from batch file
delayStart	2	time when delay starts in years since programme start

### High worm burden. 
highBurdenBreaks	0 5 10 100	## Three categories here. 
highBurdenValues	20 30 40	## Corresponding values. Using HIGH VALUES from Chan now. 

### Size parameter of negative binomial for KK test
k_epg	0.3	

### Simulation-specific parameters
nNodes	8	## number of cores, in practice is detected automatically on cluster 
maxStep	0.01923	## max time step for deterministic update of freeliving populations, approx 1/52
seed	123	##

### egg counts
moderateIntensityCount	208.3
highIntensityCount	2083.3
